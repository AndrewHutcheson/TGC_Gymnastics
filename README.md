The meet scoring and registration system and other web apps I made for the Texas Gymnastics Conference. This repository is copyright Andrew Hutcheson and not for public use. I publish it here to showcase my work.

This web package allows the athletic teams to register for competitions, manage their team and get their payment invoices. It also has a full score entry and display system for athlete rankings and results. 

The package also runs on a database I compiled of every college in the country, every gymnastics gym and high school program. Whether they have a gymnastics club, ncaa team etc, in a custom database I created. It is displayed in a graphical format that allows for event planning based on optimum location to potential teams and minimizing average travel costs. Other functions include a marketing tool to track institutions that have been contacted in a particular campaign.

Future app plans are to add a routine feedback tool to help individual athletes construct gymnastics routines that optimize start value and help them score better in competitions.
